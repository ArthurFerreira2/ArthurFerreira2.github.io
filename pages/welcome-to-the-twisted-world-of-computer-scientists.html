    <h1 class="entry-title">Welcome to the twisted world of computer scientists</h1>
    
    <p>I am a serious Linux user switching to macOS for professional reasons. In these pages I will share my experience and give some advice for those in the same situation.</p>
<p>Don't give up, with a little effort you will fell like home in no time. And maybe you will learn to like ~~BSD~~ macOS.</p>
<p>I like computers and operating systems - all of them. I first started with CP/M on the Amstrad CPC, then the Workbench on Commodore Amiga, before landing into MS-DOS and windows 3.1 on a generic i386 PC.</p>
<p>When I entered college, I discovered Unix with Minix and Xenix. I spent three years on a marvellous HP-UX workstation. At home I adopted Linux, at the time Slackware was distributed on a dozen of 1.2MB floppies. Since then, I worked on SunOS, then Solaris and OpenBSD.</p>
<p>In 1999, my employer equipped me with a DELL Xpi under windows 98 and since then, all the laptops I got were powered by the vintage generation of Windows : NT 4, 2000, XP, 7 and 10.</p>
<p>In 2011, I purchased a Mac Mini for personal usage. I upgraded its RAM at some point and then replaced the HDD with an SSD of 1TB. I still use it today for my <strong>personal</strong> stuff, mainly to edit and manage my photos.
I know macOS, since <em>Snow Leopard</em>, I know the Apple ecosystem quite well and I'm quite an happy user.</p>
<p>Today, the servers I'm using are either under Solaris or Oracle Enterprise Linux. I have a dedicated workstation for my tests under Debian with 144GB of RAM and 24 cores, 18TB of RAID6 disk space. I'm running countless Docker containers, VMs, Databases, and, of course, <a href="https://www.nethack.org">nethack</a>.</p>
